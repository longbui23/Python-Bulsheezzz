1 Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .	
0 Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .	
0 What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .	
4 ... by the time it 's done with us , Mira Nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .	
4 Shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , Devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives .	
2 Bond-inspired ?	
0 Staggeringly dreadful romance .	
4 This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .	
1 Weird .	
4 Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
4 Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .	
2 The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .	
1 And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .	
4 The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .	
1 Ill-considered , unholy hokum .	
2 Or that the battery on your watch has died .	
3 Competently directed but terminally cute drama .	
0 This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .	
2 -LRB- Taylor -RRB- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .	
1 Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .	
1 Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .	
3 Familiar but utterly delightful .	
1 For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .	
4 Consider it ` perfection . '	
0 At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .	
3 This is a more fascinating look at the future than `` Bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .	
4 Samuel L. Jackson is one of the best actors there is .	
3 Huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling Kathy Baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women 's Augustine .	
1 But no. .	
1 Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .	
3 If you love him , you 'll like it .	
4 A new film from Bill Plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .	
2 There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .	
1 The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .	
1 Woefully pretentious .	
1 Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .	
3 Makes one thing abundantly clear .	
3 A flick about our infantilized culture that is n't entirely infantile .	
1 Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .	
1 We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .	
0 A ragbag of cliches .	
3 It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .	
3 Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .	
1 Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .	
3 And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .	
4 Exudes the fizz of a Busby Berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza .	
1 For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .	
3 An engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement .	
2 with a couple of burnt-out cylinders	
3 Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down .	
4 A moving story of determination and the human spirit .	
4 We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .	
0 Disgusting .	
1 ` Moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '	
2 Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .	
2 The culmination of everyone 's efforts is given life when A Selection appears in its final form -LRB- in `` Last Dance '' -RRB- .	
3 It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .	
0 Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .	
2 Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .	
4 Mike Leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life	
3 If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change .	
1 Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	
3 It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .	
3 Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .	
3 Shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .	
0 As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .	
3 The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .	
1 It never rises to its clever what-if concept .	
3 Much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice .	
2 A sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration .	
4 A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .	
0 Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .	
4 It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .	
4 Williams creates a stunning , Taxi Driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .	
3 Campbell Scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of Roger Swanson .	
3 Has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of B-movie excitement .	
1 With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .	
3 Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .	
3 A witty , whimsical feature debut .	
4 Exhilarating , funny and fun .	
1 As an entertainment destination for the general public , Kung Pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .	
3 Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .	
1 None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .	
2 The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .	
1 Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .	
3 It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .	
3 The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .	
2 Even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , East-vs .	
1 The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .	
3 Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .	
1 This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .	
1 In this case zero .	
1 Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .	
3 Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .	
3 It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .	
0 The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .	
2 ... either you 're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you 're not .	
2 Despite these annoyances , the capable Clayburgh and Tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age .	
1 -LRB- Tries -RRB- to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the United States .	
1 The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .	
2 The film is darkly atmospheric , with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst 's forced avuncular chortles .
