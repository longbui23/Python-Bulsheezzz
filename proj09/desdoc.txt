DEFINE
a. Identify the distinct components necessary for the program.
i. Give names to the variables and functions you will use!
	+Variables: board, boxes, divider, winner, move
	+Functions: prBoard(movelist), checkwin(checklist), boardoverload(board), usermove(move), compmove(move), getMouse, 

b. Describe or explain components that are especially complex and/or critical.
We need to use GUI code for user's move and translate coordinates into strings or lists by determining player's move with a mouse click to not only record the moves into the GUI but also a tool to check who has won the game.

c. Use “black boxes” as placeholders for the components you do not yet understand.
+ record users move into a list
+ represent computer move into the GUI interface
+ check coordinates and record it to evaluate who won the game
+ what if the user click in invalid position (clicking outside the game box or the box that already have a 'x' or 'o')?

DESIGN
a. Written description:
	+The program will draw 9 boxes into GUI and allow the user to click on
	+ if user click on the box: 
		x show up at that place
	elif user click in invalid space:
		inform user that is not a valid move
	computer's turn
	check win/ draw/ lost

b. pseudocode (based and developed from lab09.py)
#in main.py
import random, funx, graphics packages
print out intro

#in funx.py
+define new functions: +draw x and draw y
                       +draw boards in GUI
					   +allow user's to draw x on the board
                       +computer GUI move
        			   +check win
					   + draw

#in main.py
initiates variables
drawBoard in GUI
print intro

while loop to allow players to replay after a turn
	playerturn
	display player's turn and draw box
	remove picked position from the list
	conditional statement to check whether player have won the game or any box remains
		if player has won -> congrats
		if no box remains -> it is a tie
		if no one has won -> continue the game
		computer's move 
			generate a random move and removed it from the list
			display move and update the board
			check whether the computer has won the game

End the program
