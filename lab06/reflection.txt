R1. The utilitarian car would provide more benefit for society as a whole since if any unwanted accidents happens, the driveless car would try the best to minimize the fatalities as much as possible.

R2. If I am the passenger, I would prefer a selfish car since it priortizes my life as the ultimate thing to protect. If anyone else chose the same decision as me, I think society will be more chaos since you are the only one who could protect yourself if any unwanted things happen.

R3. Based on the analysis above, I strongly believe that goverment should make driveless cars abiding the laws.
